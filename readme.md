-   Imagine you were developers for a video game that takes place in your room. Choose an object in your room and think about how it could serve as an interactive element in the game. What properties and actions could this object have? (each person chooses an object).  `inputfield`
-   Think of reasons why an object can have multiple constructors and give an example.  `inputfield`
-   Can there be a class in Java that does not have a single object?  `inputfield`
-   Can there be an object in Java that does not belong to any class?  `inputfield`

Create a class 'Car' together that represents the properties and methods of a car.

-   Step 1: Define the properties of a car, e.g. 'Brand', 'Model', 'Color', 'Year of Manufacture', etc.
-   Step 2: Implement a method that "starts" the car and outputs a message.
-   Step 3: Create an object of the class 'Car' and call the method to start it.
-   Step 4: Extend the class 'Car' with a property 'Speed' and a method that "accelerates" the car and changes the speed.
-   Step 5: Create a second object of the class 'Car', accelerate it, and display the speed.
-   If you have already completed this task earlier, you may work on the bonus task on the next page.

If you like, also work on this optional bonus task.

-   Class 'Person'  `inputfield`
-   Create a class 'Person' that contains properties like 'Name', 'Age', 'Gender', etc.
-   Implement a method that introduces the person, for example, 'Hello, I am [Name] and [Age] years old.'
-   Create objects of the class 'Person' for different individuals and call the introduction method.
