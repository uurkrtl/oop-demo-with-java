Create a class 'Car' together that represents the properties and methods of a car.

-   Step 1: Define the properties of a car, e.g. 'Brand', 'Model', 'Color', 'Year of Manufacture', etc.
-   Step 2: Implement a method that "starts" the car and outputs a message.
-   Step 3: Create an object of the class 'Car' and call the method to start it.
-   Step 4: Extend the class 'Car' with a property 'Speed' and a method that "accelerates" the car and changes the speed.
-   Step 5: Create a second object of the class 'Car', accelerate it, and display the speed.
